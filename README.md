# Crop Recommendation Project
**PROJECT LINK **  https://crop-recommendation-lfv7.onrender.com
## Overview
The Crop Recommendation Project leverages machine learning algorithms to provide users with tailored crop and fertilizer suggestions based on their specific soil and weather conditions. By analyzing key parameters such as Nitrogen (N), Phosphorus (P), Potassium (K), and real-time weather data, this application aims to assist farmers in making informed decisions about crop selection.
## Technologies Used
### Frontend
**HTML:** For structuring the web pages.

**Tailwind CSS:** For styling and responsive design.
### Backend
**Flask:** A lightweight Python web framework for building the backend.
### Machine Learning Algorithms used
**For Crop Recommendation:** `Random Forest Classifier`

**For Fertilizer Recommendation:** `Logistic Regression`

### Data Sources
**Soil Nutrient Data -** User-provided input for N, P, and K levels.

**Weather Data -** Real-time weather information, fetched via the OpenWeatherMap API.
